							<h2>This is what I did this summer!</h2>

						<div class="12u$">
            I am very passionate about my music, like VERY passionate, like, I once pulled an all nighter to make a playlist, and spent 66 days 8 hours 9 minutes and 36 seconds listening to music in 2018, that’s almost 1/5th of my year! (That’s just Spotify, thanks a lot for the data @spotifywrapped.com). 
Having not had the time to truly work on a personal project this last year (the electrical engineering life really caught up to me) I decided to, like every other intern who doesn’t know what to do outside of the 9-5 and working out, to dive deeper into some b u z z w o r d s. Having attended an absolutely phenomenal talk by (insert magenta person here) on project magenta, music and machine learning seemed like the natural choice. So here is a little exploration I did into the world of Billboard top 100s starting the week of August 5th 1972 (my mother’s birthdate) to see what trends I could identify and explore using the ever useful Spotify web API, a very generous billboard scraping tool by (insert person) the musixmatch api, google trends api, and of course M A C H I N E L E A R N I N G.

I also wanted to delve into ML a little deeper than just import scikit as sk, so I decided to write my own implementation of some models based on my understanding of them just to compare performance and accuracy. 

So here are some of the things I uncovered!

If you would like to see the code for this project it resides here (GitHub link)

As I was doing this mini-project my inner designer started craving some attention and so here is a little dashboard that created that let’s you view the insights in some p r e t t y visualizations :)
