							<h2>This is what I did this summer!</h2>

						<div class="12u$">
            I am very passionate about my music, like VERY passionate, like, I once pulled an all nighter to make a playlist, and spent 66 days 8 hours 9 minutes and 36 seconds listening to music in 2018, thatâ€™s almost 1/5th of my year! (Thatâ€™s just Spotify, thanks a lot for the data @spotifywrapped.com). 
Having not had the time to truly work on a personal project this last year (the electrical engineering life really caught up to me) I decided to, like every other intern who doesnâ€™t know what to do outside of the 9-5 and working out, to dive deeper into some b u z z w o r d s. Having attended an absolutely phenomenal talk by on project magenta, music and machine learning seemed like the natural choice. So here is a little exploration I did into the world of Billboard top 25s starting the week of August 5th 1972 (my motherâ€™s birthdate) to see what trends I could identify and explore using the ever useful Spotify web API, a very generous billboard scraping tool, the musixmatch api, google trends api, and of course M A C H I N E L E A R N I N G.

							While I am still working on a lot of the ~buzzwordy~ aspects of this projects, I decided to make the data I collected, publicly available and see what other creative engineers decide to do with the data! ðŸ˜„
